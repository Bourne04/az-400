# Lab VM Setup Guide

- Install Software
- Setup Windows Subsystem for Linux & Docker Support
- Create Lab VM (optional)
- Examine my prefered VS Code Settings (optional)

## Install Software

To install Software run the script `setup-az-204.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell prompt:

![run-as](_images/run-as.jpg)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARambazamba/AZ-204/master/Setup/setup-az-204.ps1'))
```

> Note: This script will run for approx 20 min. No need to wait! In the meantime you can continue to fork and clone my repo as described in the next section.

Congratulations you have completed the base setup of your class vm.
